#  performance

I haven't benchmarked my encoder / decoder but it could probably use some work. :)

I'm thinking something along the lines of using split and append, but I'm not sure. I'm not a computer scientist, so I'm not sure how to analyze the space or big-o efficiency of the technique, but I'm sure it could probably be faster somehow. Fortunately, KISS frames generally aren't going to come fast enough to overwhelm anything ;-)
